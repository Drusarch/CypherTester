CypherTester is a program which takes an input (preferably resembling a password of some kind), and attempts to run it through a myriad of known Cyphers. 

It will here give the time it took to identify the relevant cypher, and attempt to crack it. This leaves a result in seconds of how long it took to crack the password.

CypherTester will NOT work if the given password is not encoded in one of the established Cyphers.
